Programming-Portfolio
=====================

This folder contains my programming exploits.

Brief Description of Each project:

1. SIMPLECLIENTSERVER - a project consisting of 4 miniature projects that built into 1 final thing (a simple client server interaction with the client having 3 available commands, and the server having a response for each command, and the ability to run commands from the client automatically from within the code). More information on how the folder is structured is in the readme for that project folder. The main point of the project was to explore how threads and processes work, and how socket/network programming works.
