Programming-Portfolio
=====================

programming that I've done alone or with a team during school for show

The first programming project called AlienDoom is written in Java, and has a standalone executable jar file for it to be played without necessarily looking at all the code. The code is there so that my coding style and ability can be moderately assessed. 

The second programming project called Reversi was written in C++, and the AI files of the project were written by me. The other files were written by my partners within the class. The AI code took me approximately a full work week of hours to do, and it is still quite buggy. The implementation I feel is awkward, but strange to approach in the first place due to the representation of the game-board.
