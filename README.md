Programming-Portfolio
=====================

This folder contains programming projects that I've done mostly alone

The only one that was not performed alone was the Reversi project, which was done with a team of two other guys and myself. 

Brief Description of Each project: 
1. ALIENDOOM - The first programming project called AlienDoom is written in Java, and has a standalone executable jar file for it to be played without necessarily looking at all the code. The code is there so that my coding style and ability can be moderately assessed. The project though is in refactor mode, and unfortunately due to school, I have not been able to do too much with it lately. 

2. REVERSI - The second programming project called Reversi was written in C++, and the AI files of the project were written solely by me. The other files were written by my partners within the class. The code is still quite buggy. The implementation I feel is awkward, but strange to approach in the first place due to the representation of the game-board, and the fact that prior to that experience, I have never in my life done anything close to building an AI. Also, the use of the minimax algorithm was required by the professor for the project. Alpha-beta pruning was also attempted, but ultimately commented out. I packed about 30 hours of work into the AI in about 3 days. 

3. DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM - should be rather self explanatory. This was an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm done in my CSCE 221 class a couple of years ago. 

4. JARSNMARBLES - was another one done in CSCE 221, where we created virtual jars, and filled them with marbles and could do operations to the jars similar to basic set operations. We implemented the jars with two different structures (linked lists, and vectors) for the comparison of the two structures. 

5. SIMPLECLIENTSERVER - a project consisting of 4 miniature projects that built into 1 final thing (a simple client server interaction with the client having 3 available commands, and the server having a response for each command, and the ability to run commands from the client automatically from within the code). More information on how the folder is structured is in the readme for that project folder. The main point of the project was to explore how threads and processes work, and how socket/network programming works.
